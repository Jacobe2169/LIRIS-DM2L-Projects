# Pattern mining algorithms for attributed graphs

* ENERGETICS and EXPRESS are two algorithms that allow to discover exceptional patterns in vertex attributed graphs. ENERGETICS is an exhaustive algorithm while EXPRESS is an output space sampling algorithm. These algorithms were presented at IEEE ICDM 2016. For more details:

* CENERGETICS and EXCESS   are built respectively on top  ENERGETICS and EXPRESS by considering closed patterns. For more details:

* SITS-P2miner is a mining system for extracting patterns from Satellite Image Time Series. It includes four main modules for pre-processing, pattern extraction, pattern ranking and pattern visualization. It is based on the extraction of grouped frequent sequential patterns and on swap randomization.
